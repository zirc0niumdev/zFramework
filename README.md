# zFramework
Roleplay Framework for [FiveM](https://github.com/citizenfx/fivem) made in `CJS/ESM`(both usages are possible with Babel) client-side and `node.JS` server-side
This project is unfinished and the code was only used to be for prototyping. I will not update or continue this project since i will not use or play FiveM again.

This project was used to be a custom Framework for **SantosRP**


## How to use
`npm install` to install modules
`npm run build` to compile files
