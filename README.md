# zFramework
Roleplay Framework for [FiveM](https://github.com/citizenfx/fivem) made in `CJS/ESM`(both usages are possible with Babel) client-side and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) server-side

This project is unfinished and the code was only used to be for prototyping. I will not update or continue this project since i will not use or play FiveM again.

This project was used to be a custom Framework for **SantosRP**

## How to use
- You need node.JS (npm)
- `npm install` to install modules
- `npm run build` to compile files
- Create a .env file with this content (change this with your db settings.)
